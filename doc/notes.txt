Improvement Ideas / Suggestions
+ Preprocessing Step: sort methods + spots by ratio
- Preprocessing Step: Eliminate impossible (partial) solutions in advance
- Representation: Store as (linked) list of edges, faster edge exchange and insert/remove, can be sorted
- Allow intermediate invalid solutions: accept longer inserted tours, then run edge cleanup

TODOs
- Create subdirectory for first/second report
- Keep track of timestamp of best found solution

- NodeInserter.addNewNode: avoid crossovers, insert with minimal tour increase
- NodeInserter: faster/more efficient way for selecting edges to insert? Early exit criteria to improve speed
- TourNeighborhoods: check runtime?
- Testing
    - Try combinations of neighborhoods for VND, GVNS to improve on satisfaction + runtime
    - Try combinations of arguments for neighborhoods (maxLength, minLength, different inserter, allow insert used spots/methods, early
      exits, algorithms to insert new nodes?)
- Statistics about number of improvements per VND neighborhood, runtime of neighborhoods
